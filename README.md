# ConversionQs

This command line tool generates random numbering system (radix) questions for quizzes or exams. The question languages supported are Finnish and English.

The questions are either simple radix conversion questions, for example:

> Convert the value 107 to radix: hexadecimal.
> Consider the values to be signed bytes, with eight bits.
> Include in the answer the prefix for the radix (0x, 0b) asked, if it is not decimal, e.g. 0x2C or 0b00010110.
> Otherwise, use only the digits of the requested numbering system, no spaces or other punctuations!

Or simple arithmetic add operations:

> What is the result of the calculation as decimal number: 32 + 0x29
> Consider the values to be unsigned eight bits.

Both question types use eight bit integer values. Add questions use only positive (unsigned) eight bit values.

Generated questions with correct answers and default grading are saved into a Moodle quiz XML file. The file can then be imported to Moodle question bank.

## Building

The tool depends on Swift argument parser, as can be seen from the `Package.swift` file.

From the terminal, build the tool:

```console
swift build -c release
```

Or open the `Package.swift` file from Xcode.

## Running

Run the tool from Xcode, first editing the Product scheme having suitable arguments the tool requires (see below). 
 
Or run the tool from command line, with suitable argument values, e.g.:

```console
./.build/release/ConversionQs test.xml 20 en --verbose
```

First argument is required, the rest being optional with default values:

1. The output XML file name. If the file exists, it is overwritten.
2. Number of each question type to generate. Value 20 generates 20 conversion and 20 addition questions.
3. Language of the questions, "fi" for Finnish, "en" for English.
4. --verbose flag prints progress information. If not provided the tool prints nothing when all goes OK. 

Run the command with `-h`flag to see the instructions:

```console
> ./.build/release/ConversionQs -h
